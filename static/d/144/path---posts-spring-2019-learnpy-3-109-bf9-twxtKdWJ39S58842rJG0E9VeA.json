With what we know from the last two sessions of Learn.py, we can write code like this:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">p1_name = \"Iron man\"\np1_age = 45\np1_fav_food = \"cheese burger\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, we can see that the variables describing a single person <code>p1</code> are stored separately. Imagine if you want to create 10 people in your program, you have to write 30 lines of code just to store their properties. What if you want to have 100 people? Your code is going to be very messy and inefficient. As a programmer, we care a lot about writing readable and scalable code.</p>\n<p>A way to overcome this is to use a class.</p>\n<h3>What is a class?</h3>\n<a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/48a11/classmeme.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 76.2%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"classmeme\" title src=\"/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/48a11/classmeme.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/aca85/classmeme.jpg 163w,\n/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/0954f/classmeme.jpg 325w,\n/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/48a11/classmeme.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<p><a\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\"\n    href=\"/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/48a11/classmeme.jpg\"\n    style=\"display: block\"\n    target=\"_blank\"\n    rel=\"noopener\"\n  >\n    <span\n    class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\"\n    style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\"\n  >\n    <span\n      class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\"\n      style=\"padding-bottom: 76.2%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url('data:image/jpeg;base64,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'); background-size: cover; display: block;\"\n    ></span>\n    <img\n        class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\"\n        style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\"\n        alt=\"classmeme\"\n        title=\"\"\n        src=\"/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/48a11/classmeme.jpg\"\n        srcset=\"/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/aca85/classmeme.jpg 163w,\n/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/0954f/classmeme.jpg 325w,\n/static/e445807a5c54926c5542b7fc73edf2a6/48a11/classmeme.jpg 500w\"\n        sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\"\n      />\n  </span>\n  </a></p>\n<p>A class is a logical grouping of data and functions. Think of it as a \"blue-print\". A class is not something in itself. It simply describes how to make something. We establish that we can customize variable types stored in a class. Variables in a class are called <strong>attributes</strong>. We can also define functions within a class, called <strong>methods</strong>. Once we define our class, we can create a variable from the class, called an <strong>object</strong>. An object of a class contains properties and methods defined within that class. Each object is independent of each other.</p>\n<p>So now that we have a clearer idea of what these terms are, let's dive down to see what the actual code looks like.\nHere is a simple way we can declare our Person class.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Person:\n    name = \"blah\"\n    age = 12\n    fav_food = \"ramen\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>Now we can create a <code>Person</code> <strong>object</strong> called <code>p1</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">p1 = Person()\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can reference the attributes of a <code>Person</code> object by using the <strong>dot notation</strong>. This is a way of telling Python that you want to read a value of an attribute from a particular object.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">print(p1.name)\nprint(p1.age)\nprint(p1.fav_food)\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can see that our <code>Person</code> object, by default, has a name \"blah\", age 12, and a fav_food \"ramen\" as declared in the class definition.</p>\n<p>We can change the values of these properties one by one.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">p1.name = \"Iron man\"\np1.age = 45\np1.fav_food = \"cheese burger\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, this is very repetitive. Keep in mind that we want our program to be scalable, meaning that we want to be able to write a large program that can handle hundreds of thousands of people. Having to change the values of the attributes one by one is not efficient at all. Luckily, Python understands our pain and has a solution to this problem.</p>\n<h3><code>__init__()</code> function</h3>\n<p>We can use Python's built-in <code>__init__()</code> function to set the values of the attributes to whatever we want right when we declare an object. Notice that <code>__init__()</code> is short for <strong>initialization</strong> (Hint! It is indeed used to initialize objects)</p>\n<p>On one hand, the <code>__init__()</code> function is just like a good old function we learned about. It takes in parameters, does some modifications, and does not return anything. On the other hand, it is a special function inside a class (hence it is a <strong>method</strong>). It is special because we do not have to call it explicitly. Python will call the <code>__init__()</code> method automatically when we create an object of a class.</p>\n<p>The <code>__init__()</code> method has a special parameter called <code>self</code> which basically describes the particular instance of the object that calls the method. Note that we do not have to pass <code>self</code> explicitly as an argument. Here is how we use the <code>__init__()</code> method.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Person:\n        def __init__(self, name, age, fav_food):\n            self.name = name\n            self.age = age\n            self.fav_food = fav_food\n\n p1 = Person(\"Iron man\", 45, \"cheese burger\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>This is a standard way of writing the <code>__init__()</code> method. It automatically takes in <code>self</code> as the first argument along with values for attributes inside your class, which in this case is <code>name</code>, <code>age</code>, and <code>fav_food</code>. Notice the dot notation here again as our program is trying to tell Python \"Hey! We want to change the name, age, and favorite food of this object we just created (aliased by <code>self</code>).</p>\n<p>Now if we print the name, age, and fav_food of <code>p1</code>, we will indeed get \"Iron man\", 45, and \"cheese burger\"!\nWe can create as many objects of a class as we want and each one of them will have its own \"memory\". So let's say if we create</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">p2 = Person(\"Thanos\", 110, \"Infinity stones\")\n</code></pre>\n<p><code>p1</code> will not know anything about <code>p2</code> i.e. \"Iron man\" does not know that \"Thanos\" exists, nor does he know that \"Thanos\" is hungry for some infinity stones.</p>\n<p><code>__init()__</code> is one example of a method that we can create in a class. We can also create other methods. Since a class is like a collection of methods, we can create as many as we want. Let's now create a method called <code>birthday()</code> in our <code>Person</code> class that prints out <code>\"Happy Birthday!\"</code> and increments the person's age by one.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">class Person:\n    def __init__(self,name,age,fav_food):\n        self.name = name\n        self.age = age\n        self.fav_food = fav_food\n\n    def birthday(self):\n        print(\"Happy Birthday!\")\n        self.age += 1\n\np1 = Person(\"Iron man\", 45, \"cheese burger\")\np2 = Person(\"Thanos\", 110, \"Infinity stones\")\n\nprint(p1.age)\nprint(p2.age)\n\np1.birthday()\n\nprint(p1.age)\nprint(p2.age)\n</code></pre>\n<p>A few things to notice from this code:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Here we can see that after calling <code>birthday()</code>, the age of <code>p1</code> increases from 45 to 46 but the age of <code>p2</code> does not change. This again emphasizes that each object of a class is independent. Calling <code>birthday()</code> on <code>p1</code> only changes the attributes of <code>p1</code> and has nothing to do with <code>p2</code>.</li>\n<li>This goes back to the importance of the dot notation. It might not be clear what the dot notation is for when we only have one object. However, if we have multiple objects, the dot notation lets us tell our program which object we want to read the age from.</li>\n<li>When we define a method in a class, we always have to declare the <code>self</code> parameter as the first argument of the method. However, when we are actually calling our method on an object, we don’t have to pass in <code>self</code> explicitly. Python will automatically pass in <code>self</code> for us.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Now let's try creating another method that takes in an argument. We declare another method called <code>change_of_heart()</code> that takes in an argument called <code>new_fav_food</code> and changes the current fav_food of the person.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">    def change_of_heart(self, new_fav_food):\n        self.fav_food = new_fav_food\n</code></pre>\n<p>Note that when we call this method with our <code>Person</code> object, we have to pass in one argument or we will get an error.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">p1.change_of_heart(\"avocado toast\")\n</code></pre>\n<p>Try this and see what happens!</p>\n<p>Remember <code>list</code>, a Python data structure that we learned from last session? We can integrate that with our <code>Person</code> class by creating a list of persons as well!</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">person_list = []\nperson_list.append(p1)\nperson_list.append(p2)\nprint(person_list[0].name)\n</code></pre>\n<p>Wait a minute... Notice something similar between</p>\n<p><code>p1.change_of_heart(\"avocado toast\")</code> and <code>person_list.append(p2)</code>?</p>\n<p>They both use a dot notation to access some functions that modify the variable before the dot!</p>\n<a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/982aee8cfe9899a236e02e3999733bba/48a11/ahha.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 102.4%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"I-knew-it\" title src=\"/static/982aee8cfe9899a236e02e3999733bba/48a11/ahha.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/982aee8cfe9899a236e02e3999733bba/aca85/ahha.jpg 163w,\n/static/982aee8cfe9899a236e02e3999733bba/0954f/ahha.jpg 325w,\n/static/982aee8cfe9899a236e02e3999733bba/48a11/ahha.jpg 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<p><code>list</code> is also a class, but it is defined by Python!! In addition to list, other data structures such as dictionaries, sets, tuples are all examples of classes as well. These classes also contain many methods for example <code>list.append()</code>, <code>tuple.insert()</code>, and <code>set.add()</code> and so on and so forth.</p>\n<p>So class is a concept that is used a lot in Python or any object-oriented programming languages (such as Java, C, C++). It is therefore important for you to have a good understanding of what it is and how to use it.</p>\n<h3>Encapsulation</h3>\n<p>Encapsulation is an important programming concept that ties in nicely when we are talking about classes and objects.\nObjects in Python can be used for encapsulation. A lot of times you would want to do something with an object – for example, you may wish to give a Person something to eat. However, you don't want to have to know all the nitty-gritty details about how a Person actually eats and digests. You just want to type</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">p1.eat('kale')\n</code></pre>\n<p>And not have to worry about what goes on behind the scenes or how the <code>eat</code> function is executed. This is what classes allow us to do.\nWe can also see that Python integrated the concept of encapsulation in many of its applications.\nOne example is in file handling which we are about to learn!</p>\n<h2>Exercise:</h2>\n<h3>Overview</h3>\n<p>Now that you have a brief introduction to classes, let's write our own class!</p>\n<h3>Task</h3>\n<p>Write a class Student that has the following attributes:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>name</li>\n<li>gpa</li>\n<li>stressLevel  #out of 100</li>\n<li>swipes</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Since all of these are defining attributes of a Student, make sure that the Student is given a name, GPA, swipes and stress level when they are being created</p>\n<p><strong>Hint</strong>: Think about the init function.</p>\n<p>In addition, because the Student has so much on their plate, they can fail a class! When they fail a class, their stress levels shoot up by 10, their GPA drops by 0.1, and they scream “big oof i’m stressed to like x% of my capacity, i need boba” where x is going to be their actual stress level. But know that our student’s stress level cannot go beyond 100, because they practice self-care :D</p>\n<p>Our hungry students eat on the UCLA meal plan, and are capable of spending 1 swipe every time they ‘eatMeal’. They’re all on premier plans, so they can also swipe in for more guests (remember that guest includes the student themself) But if they don’t have enough swipes for themselves and the number of <strong>other</strong> guests they bring, they cry “big oof! Out of swipes!” If the student chooses not to disclose how many guests they are bringing, assume they bring just 1 guest (aka just themself).</p>\n<p>However, if the student does have enough swipes, make sure to reduce the swipes they have once they swipe for the meal, according to how many people they’re bringing! Just like every practical student, after using the swipes, the student also counts and says “I have x swipes left”. Eating the meal also relaxes the student a little, and their stress levels drop by 5. But remember: your stress levels cannot go below 0! (Our students do not get involved in substance abuse)</p>\n<p><strong>Hint</strong>: Think about default arguments.</p>\n<p>Lastly, our student needs a mini elevator pitch of all their information. Every time they’re told to ‘printInfo’, they should say:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">Student Info:\nName: x  #x is their real name\nGPA: x  #x is their real GPA\nStress Level: x  #x is their real stress level\nSwipes: x  #x is their real swipe count \n</code></pre>\n<h3>Sample use:</h3>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">s1 = Student(‘Cady Heron’, 3.75, 55, 127)\ns1.printInfo()\ns1.failAClass()\ns1.eatMeal()\ns1.eatMeal(5)\ns1.printInfo()\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Output</strong>:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">Student Info:\nName: Cady Heron\nGPA: 3.75\nStress Level: 55\nSwipes: 127\nbig oof i’m stressed to like 65% of my capacity, i need boba\nI have 126 swipes left\nI have 121 swipes left\nStudent Info:\nName: Cady Heron\nGPA: 3.65\nStress Level: 55\nSwipes: 121\n</code></pre>\n<h2>File handling</h2>\n<h3>Motivation:</h3>\n<p>Often times, we need to deal with files in our applications.\nSuppose we are writing a translator that translates Harry Potter books in any language to English.\nYou might be wondering, how are we going to input the entire book into our program?\nTelling a programmer to type the entire book in to the program sounds horrible.\nThe publishers should have electronic copies (.txt) of Harry Potter somewhere, right?\nSo why don't we just tell our program to read from those instead!</p>\n<h3>How does our program read from a file?</h3>\n<p>How do you read a file on your computer? You double click the file icon you want to read from to open the file. You then start reading the file, typically from the beginning to the end of file. You then close the file when you are done.\nOur program does the same thing when we try reading from a file! Python provides functions that perform actions equivalent to what we do as humans but in machine language. Let's now learn about some operations we can perform on a file.</p>\n<h3>Opening a file</h3>\n<p><strong>Syntax</strong>: <code>open(filename, mode)</code>\nThe <code>open()</code> function returns a <strong>file object</strong>.\nJust like humans, our program has to open the file before reading or writing from it!</p>\n<h4>Side note: File object</h4>\n<p>Python provides a <code>File class</code> (Wow! Isn't that useful we just learned about classes!) for us to use in file handling. The class has various methods such as <code>open()</code>, <code>read()</code>, <code>write()</code>, and <code>close()</code>. It also contains an object called <strong>file object</strong> which is returned when calling <code>open()</code>. A file object is an example of encapsulation; it lets us read from and write to a file without being concerned about what goes on under the hood. Reading and writing to a file involves some machine language instructions but we do not have to worry about that because the file object handles that for us.</p>\n<p>There are five modes for opening a file:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><code>'r'</code>: read; return error if file does not exist</li>\n<li><code>'w'</code>: write; create file if file does not exist</li>\n<li><code>'r+'</code>: read and write</li>\n<li><code>'a'</code>: append; create file if file does not exist</li>\n<li><code>'x'</code>: create; return error if file exists</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Closing a file</h3>\n<p>As human, when we are done reading and writing to a file we normally close the file to free up some system resources. Our program has to do the same thing. Python provides a <code>close()</code> method which is equivalent to clicking the X button on the top right corner of your file to exit the file. A standard way of making sure that a file is properly closed after user finishes using to is to use the <code>with</code> keyword. We will show you how to use  <code>with</code> in the next example.</p>\n<h3>Methods for file objects</h3>\n<h3><code>read()</code></h3>\n<p>To read from a file, we can use methods provided by Python.</p>\n<p><code>f.read()</code> reads the entire file and returns a string from the corresponding file.</p>\n<p> If the end of file has been reached, <code>read()</code> returns an empty string.</p>\n<p>Let's now try reading from a file. First create a file, called <code>file.txt</code>, on your Desktop and input as content</p>\n<pre><code>Hello World!\nThis is our new text file.\n</code></pre>\n<p>We will then write a Python script to read from this file. Create a python script called <code>file_handling.py</code> on your Desktop which contains:</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">with open('file.txt', 'r') as f:\n    read_data = f.read()\n    print(read_data)\n</code></pre>\n<p>We can see that <code>read_data</code> is a string containing the content of <code>file.txt</code> so when we print out this string, the content of the file is outputted to the console.</p>\n<h3>readline()</h3>\n<p>We can also use the <code>readline()</code> method to read an entire line from a file.

Syntax errors are one of the most common types of errors.\nHowever, another type of error are called <strong>exceptions</strong>.\nThey are run-time errors and sometimes they can be fatal.\nExamples of exceptions are dividing by zero, using undefined variables, and parsing strings with integers.\nThis code will cause Python to throw an exception at us if we input anything that is not a number.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">while True:\n    x = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n</code></pre>\n<h3>Motivation:</h3>\n<a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/5f0fe84aab7b62c0cbc2b904a03f08f7/e2288/try_catch.jpg\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 640px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 64.99999999999999%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/jpeg;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"try-catch-meme\" title src=\"/static/5f0fe84aab7b62c0cbc2b904a03f08f7/e2288/try_catch.jpg\" srcset=\"/static/5f0fe84aab7b62c0cbc2b904a03f08f7/aca85/try_catch.jpg 163w,\n/static/5f0fe84aab7b62c0cbc2b904a03f08f7/0954f/try_catch.jpg 325w,\n/static/5f0fe84aab7b62c0cbc2b904a03f08f7/e2288/try_catch.jpg 640w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<p>We can see that from this example, our program asks the user to input a number.\nIf we input a letter, the program crashes with an exception message.</p>\n<p>However, there are times that we might not want our program to crash or exit.\nImagine if you are writing a Python code for Facebook Ads, specifically for the section where users have to input their credit card number for making a purchase.\nIf a user accidentally entered anything that is not a number, you don't want your application to crash and exit right?\nWe can handle the exceptions and customize them to behave in the way we like with a <code>try/except</code> statement.\nFor example, instead of quitting the program, we can handle this exception by printing an error message and asking the user to input a number again.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">while True:\n    try:\n        x = int(input(\"Please enter a number: \"))\n        break\n    except:\n        print(\"Oops!

As a (good) programmer, you want to group functions that do similar things into one file.\nSo our program will consist of multiple files which make it more readable and is easier to debug.\nGenerally, we would have some file containing definitions of functions, classes, or variables to be used in the main program and one file containing the main program stating the logics of what to be done next.\nThose multiple files are called <strong>modules</strong>. (If you know C or C++, they are called libraries!)</p>\n<h3>Motivation</h3>\n<p>As we said earlier, breaking large programs into multiple modules makes the code easier to debug and more readable.\nSome functions are also reusable e.g. generating a random number, calculating factorials, etc.\nHowever, we don't want to write code for those functions every time we use them.\nWe can therefore <code>import</code> modules containing the functions we need into our program so we write shorter and more efficient code!</p>\n<h3>How do we use a module?</h3>\n<p>We need to <strong>import</strong> the module(s) we want to use into our Python script before using it. There are <strong>A LOT</strong> of standard Python modules out there to make your life as a developer easier so you don't have to write things from scratch everytime.</p>\n<a class=\"gatsby-resp-image-link\" href=\"/static/7d001bf21bf18d4ba54bd03501a04a87/d19c0/import.png\" style=\"display: block\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-wrapper\" style=\"position: relative; display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;  max-width: 500px;\">\n    <span class=\"gatsby-resp-image-background-image\" style=\"padding-bottom: 60%; position: relative; bottom: 0; left: 0; background-image: url(&apos;data:image/png;base64,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&apos;); background-size: cover; display: block;\"></span>\n    <img class=\"gatsby-resp-image-image\" style=\"width:100%;height:100%;margin:0;vertical-align:middle;position:absolute;top:0;left:0;box-shadow:inset 0px 0px 0px 400px white;\" alt=\"import\" title src=\"/static/7d001bf21bf18d4ba54bd03501a04a87/d19c0/import.png\" srcset=\"/static/7d001bf21bf18d4ba54bd03501a04a87/19bd1/import.png 163w,\n/static/7d001bf21bf18d4ba54bd03501a04a87/d3bcb/import.png 325w,\n/static/7d001bf21bf18d4ba54bd03501a04a87/d19c0/import.png 500w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px\">\n  </span>\n  </a>\n<p>We can import from a standard module or create your own module. To import a module, we use an <code>import</code> clause at the beginning of our script.</p>\n<h3>User-defined module</h3>\n<p>Let's first create and import our own simple module!

So\nif you are interested in Python standard modules, check this <a href=\"https://docs.python.org/3/py-modindex.html\">link</a> out!</p>\n<p>Let's try importing some simple standard module called <code>math</code>.\nWe can do some cool things with it such as printing the value of <code>pi</code> or calculating the value of 5^5.</p>\n<p><em>test.py</em></p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">import math\n\nprint(math.pi)\nprint(math.pow(5,5))\n</code></pre>\n<h2>[Topics below are not covered in Learn.py session 3 but are for those who are interested in learning more]</h2>\n<h3>Decorators</h3>\n<p>Functions are objects in Python which means that they can be passed as argument to another function or defined inside another function. A <strong>decorator</strong> is like a wrapper of a function. It is useful because we can add certain behaviors to a function without permanently modifying it.</p>\n<p>Let's look at a simple <code>introduce</code> function. Suppose we want to write a decorator for this function called <code>introduce_decorator</code>.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Function decorator\ndef introduce_decorator(func):\n    print(\"Hi!\")\n    return func\n\n# Actual function\ndef introduce():\n    print(\"Nice to meet you.\")\n\nintroduce()     # print \"Nice to meet you.\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>To use a decorator, we must use the following syntax.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">introduce = introduce_decorator(introduce)\nintroduce()     # print \"Hi!\\nNice to meet you.\"\n</code></pre>\n<p>What if our actual function wants to take in argument(s)?</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\">def introduce_decorator(func):\n    def inner(*args, **kwargs):\n        print(\"Hi!\")\n        func(*args, **kwargs)\n    return inner\n\n@introduce_decorator\ndef introduce(name):\n    print(\"My name is \" + name + \". Nice to meet you.\")\n\nintroduce(\"Furn\")\n</code></pre>\n<p><strong>Side note</strong>: <code>*args</code> and <code>kwargs</code> are special syntaxes in function definitions in Python. <code>*args</code> is used to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. For example, if we define our previous <code>add</code> function to take in <code>*args</code> argument, the function can take in any number of arguments.\n<code>**kwargs</code> is used to pass a keyworded, variable-length argument list. A way to look at <code>kwargs</code> is that it is a dictionary that maps each keyword (argument) to the value that we pass with it.</p>\n<p>Here is an example of a more complicated decorator example. We declare a decorator to time the time taken by any function passed into it. In this case, we are timing the factorial function.</p>\n<pre><code class=\"language-python\"># Importing libraries\nimport time\nimport math\n\n# decorator function\ndef calculate_time(func):\n        def inner1(*args, **kwargs):\n                begin = time.time()\n                func(*args, **kwargs)\n                end = time.time()\n                print(\"Total time taken in : %s %02f\") % (func.__name__, end - begin)\n        return inner1\n\n@calculate_time\ndef factorial(num):\n        time.sleep(2)\n        print(math.factorial(num))\n\nfactorial(10)\n</code></pre>\n<h2>pip</h2>\n<p>Suppose you write a very large application that includes many modules. As the number of modules grows, it becomes difficult to keep track of them, especially if they have similar names or functionality.
